## üìÇ Knowledge Rescources

Our survey will **NOT** cover the widely-used lexical resources (such as WordNet) and factual knowledge bases (such as Wikidata), but focuses on the commonsense knowledge resources which is usually implicitly stated and considered obvious to most humans.

### Naive Physics

It's the knowledge about the physical world, properties of objects, and their interaction. For example, "A cup can hold liquid," "A ball can roll," "Fire is hot", etc.

1. 
2. 

### Intuitive Psychology

It's the knowledge about people's emotions, motivations, and mental states. For example, "People feel happy when they receive gifts," "A person may cry when they are sad", etc.

   *Erik Cambria, Yang Li, Frank Z. Xing, Soujanya Poria, Kenneth Kwok*

2. 

### Social Commonsense Knowledge

It's the knowledge about social norms, conventions, and interactions between people. For example,  "People usually greet each other when they meet," "It is polite to say 'thank you' when someone helps you", etc.

1. **Social Chemistry 101: Learning to reason about social and moral norms** `EMNLP 2020` [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00620)

‚Äã	*Maxwell Forbe,  Jena D. Hwang, Vered Shwartz, Maarten Sap, Yejin Choi* 

### Temporal Commonsense Knowledge

It's the knowledge about the temporal aspects of events and their order. For example, "Breakfast comes before dinner," "A person needs to wake up before going to work", etc.

7. Zhang, J., et al. (2022). Temporal Prompts: Predicting Temporally Consistent Commonsense Knowledge for Future Events. AAAI 2022.

### Causal Commonsense Knowledge

It's the knowledge about cause-and-effect relationships between events. For example, "Eating spoiled food can cause sickness," "Studying hard leads to better grades", etc.
